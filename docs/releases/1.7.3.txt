==========================
Django 1.7.3 release notes
==========================

*Under development*

Django 1.7.3 fixes several bugs in 1.7.2.



Bugfixes
========

* The default iteration count for the PBKDF2 password hasher has been
  increased by 25%. This part of the normal major release process was
  inadvertently omitted in 1.7. This backwards compatible change will not
  affect users who have subclassed
  ``django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher`` to change the
  default value.
